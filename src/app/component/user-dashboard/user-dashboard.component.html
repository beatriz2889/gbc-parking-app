  Welcome to the GBC Parking Reservation App. Here are a few important things to
  note:
</p>

<b><u>Make a Reservation</u> </b>
<p>
  You can reserve a parking spot at any of the three parking lots available at
  Casa Loma Campus. You may only reserve a spot if the spot is not taken and for
  a maximum time of 2 hours. You will be required to pay for the reservation at
  the time of confirmation. There is an option to extend your reservation, but
  only if there are no current reservations at the specified time and only up to
  a maximum time of 2 hours. Additional payment will be required if you choose
  to extend
</p>

<b><u>Cancellation</u></b>
<p>
  You may choose to cancel your reservation only if your reservation time has
  not yet started. The process is irreversible and your payment will be
  refunded.
</p>

<b><u>Late Fees</u></b>

<p>
  In the event that you stay past your scheduled time, you will be charged a
  late fee. You can click on the "late fees" link to view the amount owed.
</p>
